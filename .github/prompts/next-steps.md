# Group Pay - Implementation Phase

The scaffolding is complete! 🎉 This document outlines the next steps for implementing the Group Pay expense tracker MVP.

## ✅ Completed Scaffolding

- **Monorepo Structure** - pnpm workspace with apps/ and packages/
- **Modern Tooling** - ESLint flat config, TypeScript 5, Prettier, Husky
- **Build System** - All packages compile and build successfully
- **Quality Gates** - Git hooks, lint-staged, CI/CD workflow
- **Package Structure** - Shared types, config, API, and web apps

## 🚀 Implementation Priority Order

### Phase 1: Core Data Layer (Priority: HIGH)

1. **[Prisma Schema](./01-prisma-schema.md)** - Database models, relations, migrations
2. **[Shared Types & Schemas](./02-shared-types.md)** - Zod schemas, DTOs, core types
3. **[Business Logic](./03-business-logic.md)** - Currency utils, netting algorithms, split calculations

### Phase 2: Backend API (Priority: HIGH)

4. **[Database Setup](./04-database-setup.md)** - PostgreSQL, migrations, seed data
5. **[Authentication System](./05-authentication.md)** - JWT auth, argon2, routes
6. **[Core API Routes](./06-core-api.md)** - Groups, expenses, balances, settlements
7. **[API Testing](./07-api-testing.md)** - Unit tests, integration tests, E2E

### Phase 3: Frontend Application (Priority: MEDIUM)

8. **[React App Setup](./08-react-setup.md)** - Mantine UI, routing, state management
9. **[Authentication UI](./09-auth-ui.md)** - Login/register pages, protected routes
10. **[Core Components](./10-core-components.md)** - Group management, expense forms
11. **[Advanced Features](./11-advanced-features.md)** - Balances, settlements, receipts

### Phase 4: Polish & Production (Priority: LOW)

12. **[Testing & QA](./12-testing-qa.md)** - Frontend tests, E2E, accessibility
13. **[Deployment](./13-deployment.md)** - Docker, environment configs, CI/CD
14. **[Documentation](./14-documentation.md)** - API docs, user guides, dev setup

## 🎯 Quick Start Recommendations

### Option A: Database-First Approach (Recommended)

Start with the data layer to establish the foundation:

```bash
# 1. Set up Prisma schema and database
cd apps/api
# Follow: 01-prisma-schema.md

# 2. Build shared types from the schema
cd ../../packages/shared
# Follow: 02-shared-types.md
```

### Option B: API-First Approach

Build the API routes with mock data first:

```bash
# 1. Create shared types and DTOs
cd packages/shared
# Follow: 02-shared-types.md

# 2. Build API with in-memory data
cd ../../apps/api
# Follow: 06-core-api.md (with mock data)
```

### Option C: Full-Stack Feature Approach

Build complete features end-to-end:

```bash
# 1. User authentication (full stack)
# Follow: 05-authentication.md + 09-auth-ui.md

# 2. Group management (full stack)
# Follow: 06-core-api.md + 10-core-components.md
```

## 📋 Current State Assessment

### What's Working

- ✅ TypeScript compilation across all packages
- ✅ ESLint with modern flat config
- ✅ Build process for all apps
- ✅ Git hooks and formatting
- ✅ Package dependencies resolved

### What Needs Implementation

- ❌ Database schema and models
- ❌ Business logic (splits, netting, currency)
- ❌ API routes and authentication
- ❌ React components and UI
- ❌ Tests and validation

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

1. **Pick a feature** from the priority list above
2. **Read the feature prompt** (linked markdown files)
3. **Implement following the spec** in the prompt
4. **Test the implementation** (unit tests, manual testing)
5. **Commit and move to next feature**

## 📚 Reference Materials

- **Original Spec**: `.github/prompts/group_pay_copilot_prompt.md`
- **Feature Prompts**: `.github/prompts/features/` (this directory)
- **Package Structure**: See `README.md` in root
- **API Documentation**: Will be at `http://localhost:4000/docs` (Swagger)
