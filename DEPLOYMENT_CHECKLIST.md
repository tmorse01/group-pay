## Post-Deployment

### 10. Verification

- [ ] Database operations working
- [ ] CORS configuration correct
- [ ] HTTPS working on all endpoints

### 11. Monitoring Setup

- [ ] Cost monitoring alerts set up
- [ ] Application performance monitoring (if enabled)
- [ ] Error logging configured

### 12. Security Review

- [ ] Database firewall rules appropriate
- [ ] Environment variables secure
- [ ] HTTPS enforced everywhere
- [ ] Authentication working correctly
- [ ] Authorization rules in place

## Maintenance Setup

### 13. Operational Procedures

- [ ] Backup strategy documented
- [ ] Update procedures established
- [ ] Monitoring alerting configured
- [ ] Support procedures documented

### 14. Cost Management

- [ ] Billing alerts configured
- [ ] Resource usage monitoring set up
- [ ] Scaling procedures documented
- [ ] Cost optimization review scheduled

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Azure CLI Issues

```bash
# Re-login if authentication fails
az login

# Check current subscription
az account show

# Switch subscription if needed
az account set --subscription "Your Subscription Name"
```

### Terraform Issues

```bash
# Re-initialize if backend issues
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform init -reconfigure

# Check state
terraform state list

# Import existing resources if needed
terraform import azurerm_resource_group.main /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{rg-name}
```

### GitHub Actions Issues

- Check workflow logs in GitHub Actions tab
- Verify all secrets are set correctly
- Ensure branch protection rules don't block deployments
- Check Azure service principal permissions

### Application Issues

```bash
# Check App Service logs
az webapp log tail --name your-app-name --resource-group your-rg-name

# Restart App Service
az webapp restart --name your-app-name --resource-group your-rg-name

# Check database connectivity
psql "your-database-connection-string"
```
